# The deleting divisors problem from Codeforces
 If both players play optimally, who will win?
 
 Taking turns, each player must choose a factor of the given number that is not 1 or itself
 
 That number is then sutracted from the given number, and that is the new number
 
 If the number can no longer be factored besides 1 and itself, the current player loses
